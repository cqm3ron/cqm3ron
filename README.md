# Hi!
## My name is Cameron, but I sometimes go by Cam, and online I am known as cqm3ron or cqmeron.

I am a novice programmer & video game enjoyer from Manchester, England.
Currently, the languages I know are:
- âœ¨ VB.NET
- âš¡ Learning C#
- ðŸŒ± Very basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript

I also want to learn Python & Java; Python as a basic language because VB is honestly useless, and Java so that I can develop Minecraft mods.

I have experience in running a whitelist-only Minecraft server, known as BeaconCraft.

I also have a pretty long streak of learning Italian on Duolingo:

Check out my website [here](https://cqmeron.online/) (please let me know if that link is broken by opening an issue, I keep changing my domain!)

That's all for now. Thanks for checking out my Github and I hope some of my repos will be useful for you :D
