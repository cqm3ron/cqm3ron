# Hi! I'm Cameron
I am a novice programmer from Manchester, England.
Currently, the languages I know are:
- VB.NET
- Some basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge

I also want to learn Python & Java; Python as a basic language because VB is honestly useless, and Java so that I can develop Minecraft mods.
