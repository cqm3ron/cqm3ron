# Hi!
## My name is Cameron, but I sometimes go by Cam, and online I am known as cqm3ron or cqmeron.

I am a novice programmer & video game enjoyer from Manchester, England.
Currently, the languages I know are:
- ✨ VB.NET
- ✨ C#
- 🌱 Very basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- 😠 Spending a lot of time being angry at / confused by Java

I also want to learn Python & Java; Python for making Discord bots, and Java so that I can develop Minecraft mods.

Check out my website [here](https://cqmeron.uk/) (please let me know if that link is broken by opening an issue, I keep changing my domain!)

That's all for now. Thanks for checking out my Github and I hope some of my repos will be useful for you :D
